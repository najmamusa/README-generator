# ReadME Generator

## About
I wanted to construct an automated programme that generates readme files from user input. I made this project because I need a tool to optimise my process when I establish new projects and have to produce documentation. The software handles the issue of finding the right file structure and additional pleasant to haves like a table of contents and badges for project technologies. I discovered that server-side apps need node.js, a strong automation tool. My idea stands out because it addresses a real-world issue that developers confront while finishing a new project.

## Installation
Place the following into the CLI:
```
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/readme-generator.git
```
Then install necessary dependencies with:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

The application can be opened in the root directory of the application with the following command:

You will then be prompted for all the information about the project.
